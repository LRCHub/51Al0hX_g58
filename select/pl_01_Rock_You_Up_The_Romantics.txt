You know you look a little lonely
Well, I can keep you company
You want to make it with somebody
Baby won't you make it with me
[CHORUS]
want to have a good time-it's alright
Baby whatcha doing later on tonight
I want to rock you up
Rock you up
Rock you up
Rock you up
You want to do a little dancing
Well music never let you down
But if you're ready for romancing
Honey better hang around
[CHORUS]
You know you look a little lonely
Well I can keep you company
When I see you move your body
Don't you know you put me in heat
[CHORUS]
