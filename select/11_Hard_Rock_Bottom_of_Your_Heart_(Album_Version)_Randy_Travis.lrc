[00:13.86] Since the day I was led to temptation
[00:18.65] And in weakess did let your love down
[00:24.24] I have prayed that with time and compassion
[00:30.30] You'd come around
[00:38.80] 
[00:35.76] And I keep waiting for you to forgive me
[00:41.61] And you keep saying you can't even start
[00:47.57] And I feel like a stone you have picked up and thrown
[00:55.33] To the hard rock bottom of your heart
[01:00.98] To the hard rock bottom of your heart
[01:19.48] 
[01:07.01] Now, this home we have built is still standing
[01:12.44] Its foundation is on solid ground
[01:18.22] Do we roll up our sleeves and repair it
[01:24.31] Or burn it down
[01:31.81] 
[01:30.06] And I keep waiting for you to forgive me
[01:35.66] And you keep saying you can't even start
[01:41.55] And I feel like a stone you have picked up and thrown
[01:48.81] To the hard rock bottom of your heart
[01:54.67] To the hard rock bottom of your heart
[02:13.17] 
[02:01.62] We can't just block it out
[02:04.59] We've got to talk it out
[02:07.53] Until our hearts get back in touch
[02:13.13] I need your love, I miss it
[02:16.07] I can't go on like this, it hurts too much
[02:37.07] 
[02:35.70] And I keep waiting for you to forgive me
[02:41.40] And you keep saying you can't even start
[02:47.21] And I feel like a stone you have picked up and thrown
[02:54.62] To the hard rock bottom of your heart
[03:00.52] To the hard rock bottom of your heart
[03:06.30] To the hard rock bottom of your heart
[03:12.39] To the hard rock bottom of your heart
