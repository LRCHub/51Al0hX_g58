Oh wait wait wait wait shit
What song is this
Miku
MIKU STOP THE BEAT I DONT KNOW THE SOOONG
Miku is crashing out right now because someone ate her leek
And who the fuck are you
Shut up and just freestyle somethihng
You cant be serious right
Inexplicable the misery
Fumble through the cases
Tryna put myself in history
Haters gonna hate then I'm just writing all these hits for me
I'll be going down in history
Oh are you here to kill my paradise
You dirty looking parasite
Are murdering my appetite
You won't do anything
It's so embarrassing
Only the fact that you can breed is kind of threatening uh
You don't tell me what to do
Wanna end up in the news
Pulling over with the deuce
Send him straight to ICU
Only got my eyes on making legacies
Times the only enemy to matter in this world
Am I born just to feel this way
This sick and twisted girl
Are you here when I scream your name
A thousandth time so loud that I
Can't feel myself reach out no more
It is everything that's happening that makes me feel alive
I'm gone like a goner
Don't fall like I told ya
You crawl like a monster
Inexplicable the misery carve me out of history
Don't just wanna be a monster
Only cause I falter
I wanna be your idol idol
Hold me just a little closer
Til we're getting over
Melodies and high notes
Walk me to the nearest sky and
Celebrate goodbye from our desires
So heavenly
Don't just wanna be a monster
Wanna be a monster wanna be a monster wanna be a monster
What was that part about shooting people
Do I look like I know what I'm doing
You know what you look like
A DIPSHIT
That's what you look like
Fuck you at least I got my own character design
Oh yeah
I-
Tnexplicable the misery,
Pull up with a tech nine make a headline
Or a head lying
Like a man sliced off your head at the neck
With the blade of a chef knife
To fuck with me it's a bad time
I'm working hard til it's late night
Pray for the death of me
Only shows your fallacies uh
Either you win or you die die
Make it your crown or say bye bye
Only got my eyes on making legacies
Pray against the death of me to matter in this world
Am I born just to feel this way
This sick and twisted girl
Are you here when I scream your name
A thousandth time so loud that I
Can't feel myself reach out no more
It is everything that's happening that makes me feel alive
I'm gone like a goner
Don't fall like I told ya
You crawl like a monster
Inexplicable the misery carve me out of history
Don't just wanna be a monster
Only cause I falter
I wanna be your idol idol
Hold me just a little closer
Til we're getting over
Melodies and high notes
Walk me to the nearest sky and
Celebrate goodbye from our desires
So heavenly
Don't just wanna be a monster
Wanna be a monster wanna be a monster wanna be a monster
